## About

The purpose of this repository is to install AWX, GitLab, Suricata-update (with Suricata), and other supporting applications, in a local Docker environment

AWX provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). It is the upstream project for [Tower](https://www.ansible.com/tower), a commercial derivative of AWX.

To learn more about using AWX, and Tower, view the [Tower docs site](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/index.html).

## System Requirements

The system that runs the AWX service will need to satisfy the following requirements

- At least 4GB of memory
- At least 2 cpu cores
- At least 20GB of space
- Running Docker, Openshift, or Kubernetes
- If you choose to use an external PostgreSQL database, please note that the minimum version is 10+.

GitLab System Requirements

- minimum 4 cores (supports 500 users)
- minimum 4GB of memory (supports 500 users)
- storage requirements depends on the size of repositories

GitLab Runner Requirements

- a single job in a single instance
  - 1vPU
  - 3.75GB of memory

## Post-install

After the playbook run completes, Docker starts a series of containers that provide the services that make up AWX and the other services mentioned above.  You can view the running containers using the `docker ps` command.

Immediately after the containers start, the *awx_task* container will perform required setup tasks, including database migrations. These tasks need to complete before the web interface can be accessed. To monitor the progress, you can follow the container's STDOUT by running the following:

Additionally, immediately after the containers start, GitLab will perform some initial tasks that must be completed before the web interface is available on HTTP port 8330.  Those tasks can take about 3 minutes to complete.

```bash
# Tail the awx_task log
$ docker logs -f awx_task
```

For AWX you will see output similar to the following:

```bash
Using /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg as config file
127.0.0.1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "db": "awx"
}
Operations to perform:
  Synchronize unmigrated apps: solo, api, staticfiles, messages, channels, django_extensions, ui, rest_framework, polymorphic
  Apply all migrations: sso, taggit, sessions, sites, kombu_transport_django, social_auth, contenttypes, auth, conf, main
Synchronizing apps without migrations:

    Running deferred SQL...
  Installing custom SQL...
Running migrations:
  Rendering model states... DONE
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK

```

Once migrations complete, you will see the following log output, indicating that migrations have completed:

```bash

## Accessing AWX and GitLab

The AWX web server is accessible on the deployment host, using the *host_port* value set in the *inventory* file. The default URL is [http://localhost](http://localhost).

You will prompted with a login dialog. The default administrator username is `admin`, and the password is `password`.

The GitLab web server is accessible on the deployment host using HTTP on port 8330.  The default URL is [http://localhost:8330](http://localhost:8330).

The default username for GitLab is `root`.  The first time you connect you will be prompted to change the password.
